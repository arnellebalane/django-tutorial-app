django-tutorial-app
===================

Implementation of the Django tutorial application from https://www.djangoproject.com/

The different attempts in doing the tutorial are placed in different branches within this repository (to avoid creating more repositories) and are shown below:

| attempt | branch         |
| ------- | -------------- |
| first   | master         |
| second  | second-attempt |
| third   | third-attempt  |
| fourth  | fourth-attempt |

Additionally, since the last advanced part of the tutorial discussed about how to pack our own apps into their own packages, the packed packages for the polling application (django-polls) are also already included within the project directory to avoid creating a separate repository for it.
